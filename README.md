If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/`
directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that
directory, as follows:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/weareinteractive/grunt-init-node-bin.git ~/.grunt-init/node-bin
```

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow
the prompts.

```

*Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be
sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing
files.*
